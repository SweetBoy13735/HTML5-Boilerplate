# Contributing to my boilerplate
First off, thanks for having an interest in contributing. It means a lot! :D

Second, as this is my own boilerplate, I'm looking to do the heavy lifting by myself. However, I'm open to small contributions. These are:
- Issue submissions (Bug reports, feature requests, etc...)
- Hot-fixes

## Submitting an issue
If you notice a bug or you have an idea for a new feature, the best way you can communicate it to me is by submitting an issue (Provided it's not logged already).

### If you've spotted a bug:
1. Title your issue with the prefix of "**BUG REPORT:** ", following with the bug at hand.
2. Dive into further detail with a full description of what the bug is. Please try to include links to images or any console outputs if possible. If you can consistently replicate the bug, document the steps you took so it can be tracked down.

### If you want to request a feature:
1. Title your issue with the prefix of "**FEATURE REQUEST:** ", following with the feature at hand.
2. Dive into further detail with a full description of what you'd like to see on the boilerplate. Feel free to include images that help convey the idea.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Not all features will fit my preferences. If your feature is rejected, this is most likely the reason. If there's other reasons, I'll be sure to leave a comment explaining why.

## Writing a hot-fix
If you'd like to take on a bug that hasn't been responded to, here's what you'll need to do:

1. Leave a comment on the relating issue expressing your interest.
2. Once it's acknowledged and I'm happy with letting you take it on, fork the repository and commit your fixes to a hot-fix branch.
3. When your changes have been made, create a pull request into the origin's default branch and title your request as "**HOT-FIX:** ", leading on with the bug you're tackling. Add me (Sweetboy13735) as a reviewer of the changes.
4. I'll have a look and review the request. If I approve, the hot-fix will be merged. If the request still requires more changes, please take a look and amend your changes as needed. Once this is done, re-request my review and I'll have a look again.
