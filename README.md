# Sweetboy's HTML5 Boilerplate
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](https://github.com/Sweetboy13735/HTML5-Boilerplate/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

This repository is responsible for managing my custom HTML5 Boilerplate; a fork of [the official HTML5 Boilerplate template](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate-template), modified to my personal liking.

## Installation
To set up the boilerplate, you can either:
- Generate a repository using the template.
- Download a release.

### Generating the repository
1. Click "Use this template".
2. Fill out the form as you see fit and click "Create repository from template".

### Download a release
1. Select a release from the "releases" pane.
2. Download any of the "Source code" assets and extract the files to a directory of your choice.

And that's it, you're free to use the boilerplate as you wish (**NOTE:** The project documentation (README, CODE_OF_CONDUCT and CONTRIBUTING) will also be bundled, so make sure to modify it)!

## Support
If you encounter any issues with the boilerplate, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Sweetboy13735/HTML5-Boilerplate/issues) (Provided it's not logged already), or [E-Mail me](mailto:ramonegraham@gmail.com), with a full description of what the problem is.

## Roadmap
Throughout this project's development, I'll be using the [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/files/Git-branching-model.pdf) branching method to keep track of all changes.

## [Contributing](https://github.com/Sweetboy13735/HTML5-Boilerplate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
As this is my own boilerplate, I'm looking to do the heavy lifting by myself. However, I'm open to small contributions. Please check out the link above for more info.
